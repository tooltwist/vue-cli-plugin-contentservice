This Vue-cli 3 plugin will add [ContentService](http://contentservice.io) to a standard VueJS project.

Usage is simple:

    vue create my-project
    cd my-project
    vue add contentservice
    
You can then view the site in development mode:

    yarn serve

Open your browser at http://localhost:8080.

To edit the content of the page press `control-option-escape` on a Mac or `control-alt-escape` on Windows.

Note that the content shown is example data. Change it as you wish, but be aware that other people see what you enter, and also that gets reset regularly without warning so your changes may disappear.

To customise the site, or edit your own content see the [ContentService](http://contentservice.io) documentation.

For more information about this and other prefabricated application components, see the [ToolTwist](http://tooltwist.com) website.
